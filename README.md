## Introduction
ChatWithMe is a chatbot application that allows users to interact through a text-based interface. It utilizes natural language processing (NLP) techniques to understand and respond to user queries effectively. The chatbot is backed by a machine learning model trained on career-related data to provide insightful responses.

## Features
- **Text-Based Chat Interface**: Enables users to interact with the chatbot via text messages.
- **Firebase Integration**: Uses Firebase for data storage and retrieval, enhancing scalability and persistence.
- **Career Insights**: Provides career-related advice and information based on pre-trained models and data.
- **Deployment Ready**: Includes configuration files for deployment on platforms like GitHub Pages.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Programming language used for implementing the chatbot and machine learning models.
- **Firebase**: Cloud-based database for storing and managing chatbot data.
- **HTML/CSS**: Frontend languages used for creating the user interface (optional for web deployment).
- **Flask**: Micro web framework for Python used to serve the chatbot application.

## Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/divyasoni25/ChatWithMe.git
   cd ChatWithMe
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set Up Firebase**
   - Create a Firebase project and download the Firebase configuration file (`firebase.json`).
   - Modify the Firebase configuration settings in `app.py` to connect to your Firebase project.

4. **Run the Application**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
   This will start the Flask web server. Access the chatbot interface at `http://localhost:5000` in your web browser.

## Usage
1. **Interact with the Chatbot**
   Open the chatbot interface and start typing messages to interact with the chatbot. It can provide career advice and answer questions based on the trained model.
